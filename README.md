# 💭 Quick Thoughts

What if you could post something and know it wouldn’t live forever?

**Quick Thoughts** is a minimalist React app where you can post short, fleeting thoughts. Each one disappears automatically after **15 seconds**. It’s built using **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) to demonstrate dynamic state management and side effects in functional components.
